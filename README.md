##My Portfolio

My portfolio was great at first, but became very boring to me and was no longer even remotely 
representative of my abilities. I figured it was time to do something more fun with it. This
is basically my code backup; here for potential employers or curious minds to take a gander
at.

I had configured my Digital Ocean server to host my portfolio using Nginx. Being that I've
worked on MEAN stack apps the past year, I thought it was appropriate to convert my setup.
I'm not switching it over until this portfolio project is complete, but when I do you will
be able to view it at http://joeyg.me

Node for the hosting, Angular for the magic, MongoDB for a comments section.
